# Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Simulation Model
A simulation model of a PEMFC fuel cell is created to run a three-phase induction motor using a boost converter, three-phase inverter, and VFD method.

## Objective
This project aims to create a simulation model of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) that can be used to run a three-phase induction motor. The model uses a boost converter to increase the voltage output from the fuel cell and a three-phase inverter with Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique to convert the output into AC. The speed of the induction motor is regulated using a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) method.

## Installation
To run the simulation model, you need to have MATLAB software installed on your computer. Clone or download the project files from GitHub and save them in a directory of your choice.

## Usage

Open the MATLAB software on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the project files.
Open the  main.m file in MATLAB.
Modify the input parameters as per your requirements.
Run the simulation by clicking the "Run" button in MATLAB.
